# Task 4: Packet Analysis with Wireshark

This repository contains my work for **Task 4: Packet Analysis with Wireshark** as part of the **Alfido Tech Cybersecurity Internship**.

## 🔍 Objective

To capture and analyze network packets using **Wireshark** to detect and inspect network activity such as HTTP and DNS requests.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Wireshark** – For capturing and analyzing network packets
- **Linux (Kali)** – Operating system used for the task
- **Filters** – `http`, `dns` used to identify specific types of traffic

## 📸 Screenshots

| Screenshot | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `01-wireshark-interface-selection.png` | Selected the `eth0` network interface for capturing packets |
| `02-started-capturing-on-eth0.png` | Live packet capture in progress on selected interface |
| `03-http-filter-applied.png` | Applied HTTP filter to isolate web traffic |
| `04-dns-filter-applied.png` | Applied DNS filter to view domain name queries |

> ⚠️ The `.pcapng` file has not been included in this repository to protect network privacy and user data.

## 📌 Summary

Using Wireshark, I was able to:
- Capture live network traffic
- Apply filters to analyze HTTP and DNS protocols
- Understand packet details like source, destination, and protocol type

This task helped me gain hands-on experience with packet sniffing and interpreting common network behaviors.
